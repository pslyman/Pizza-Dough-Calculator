Regarding the Pizza Dough Calculator and Pizza Dough Premium apps

For now I haven't chosen to make the apps open source. Previously there were discussions, and I put word out to garner interest if anybody wanted to see or contribute to the project if I made it open source. At the time there was no interest, people wanted to use the apps but didn't care if it was FOSS. If you'd _like_ to contribute to the project, I'm not opposed to adding contributors. It doesn't contain secrets, it's just code. 

That being said, I would like to expose some of the formulas to the app. I have received permission (hence, no secrets) from one or both of the original formula creators to make this open source. At the very least I hope it is educational.
